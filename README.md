# Batto
Converting .bat file to .exe using resources

### Building
The project is written in C#, so an integrated development environment for NET is needed (Preferably Visual Studio)

### Usage
Just make the next command:
'''
Batto.exe "filename.bat"
'''
At the output, you will receive an executable file with a BAT file in its resources.
